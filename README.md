🚀 Built a Cyberpunk AI-Controlled 3D Experience using Three.js + MediaPipe

I recently developed a real-time interactive 3D system where:
✋ Hand movements control the camera
👌 Pinch gestures switch cyber themes
✊ Fist gestures trigger particle shockwaves
🎵 Audio input dynamically drives visual pulses
🧠 Fully modular, performance-optimized architecture

Tech Stack:
• Three.js (Post-processing, Bloom, HDR)
• MediaPipe Hand Landmarker
• Web Audio API
• Modular ES Architecture

This project pushed my understanding of real-time graphics, AI vision, and performance optimization.

Always learning. Always building. ⚡
